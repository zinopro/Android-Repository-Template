# GitHub Actions

This project has [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflows to validate our code for us automatically. The project currently uses two workflows. 

## Android Build

The [Android Build](/.github/workflows/android_build.yml) workflow automates the core checks for the repository: compile, unit tests, lint checks. This is set to run on every push.
